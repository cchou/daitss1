 Widow needs transportation
   A local area widow has reached out to the community, hoping
for a miracle. She is a good, hardworking, Christian lady, who is in
dire need. She desperately needs a vehicle. Preferably, it would be
an economy size car or mini-van, in fairly good mechanical shape.

Don't take Caloosa Belles
   To the few inconsiderate pet owners of LaBelle- I think you are
very rude and self centered to take the stack of new Caloosa Belle
newspapers to line your dog pens. There are many of us who
would enjoy reading the paper!


Volunteer to help Special


   Unaware to most, there are
approximately 170 million people
with   intellectual disabilities
worldwide, and more than 7 mil-
lion in the United States, many in
our own communities.
   Through Special Olympics, we
serve over one million athletes
with intellectual disabilities in
more than 160 countries provid-
ing year-round sports training and
competition in 26 Olympic-type
summer and winter sports. Yet to
reach the millions who could
benefit from this program, we
need the help of many more vol-
unteers and contributors.
   We see the abilities not the
limitations - of people with intel-
lectual disabilities. This month,
Special Olympics Florida athletes
traveled to Nagano, Japan for the
2005 World Winter Games. The


It's your worLt
   Get Involved


motto of the Games was "Let's
Celebrate Together," words that
Floridians seem to have already
embraced. Citizens everywhere
showed their support of these
extraordinary athletes by joining
forces with Publix Supermarkets
to raise over $1.1 million dollars
for Special Olympics Florida in the
month of January. This support
helps make Special Olympics a
reality for more people than ever
before.


are also clinical benefits. like
health and fitness and self-esteem
and greater social adjustment. But
at the end of the day, Special
Olympics is an environment
where people with intellectual
disabilities can be successful and
where parents can be proud of
their children. That's no small feat
given the amount of prejudice
and discrimination that most of
our athletes face on a day-to-day
basis.


   While everyone can benefit     By participating in Special
from sports, for our athletes there Olympics, people with intellectu-


Olympics
  al disabilities have gained the self-
  confidence and social skills to
  succeed both on and off the play-
  ing field: individuals once thought
  burdens to society are proving
  themselves productive citizens.
    During "Mental Retardation
  Awareness Month," if you would
  like to support a movement that
  celebrates  differences   and
  embraces acceptance and under-
  standing, call Special Olympics
  Florida at 1-800-322-HERO (4376)
  or visit us on the web at
  www.sofl.org   and  volunteer
  today. In addition, April is
  "National Volunteerism Month,"
  so get involved! Because with
  your help, everyone wins. .

SFWMD continues land acquisitions


   Tired of being broke and
stuck in an unhappy marriage, a
young husband decides to solve
both problems by taking out a
large insurance policy on his
wife, with himself as beneficiary
and arranging to have her killed.
   A "friend of a friend" put him
in touch with a nefarious under-
world figure by the name of
"Artie." Artie explained to the
husband that his going price for
snuffing out a spouse was
$5,000.
   The husband said he was
willing to pay that amount but
he wouldn't have any cash on
hand until he could collect his
wife's insurance money.
   Artie insisted on being paid
something up front. The man
opened up his wallet, displaying
a single dollar bill that rested
inside.
   Artie sighed, rolled his eyes,
and reluctantly agreed to accept
the dollar as down payment for
the dirty deed.
   A few days later, Artie fol-
lowed the man's wife into the
local Safeway grocery store.


There he surprised her in the
produce department and pro-
ceeded to strangle her with his
gloved hands. As the poor
unsuspecting woman drew her
last breath and slumped to the
floor, the manager of the pro-
duce department stumbled onto
the scene.
   Unwilling to leave any wit-
nesses behind, Artie had no
choice but to strangle the pro-
duce    manager     as   well.
Unknown to Artie, the entire
proceedings was captured by
hidden cameras and observed
by the store's security guard,
who immediately called the
police.
   Artie was caught and arrested
before he could leave the store.
   Under intense questioning at
the police station, Artie revealed
the sordid plan, including his
financial arrangements with the
hapless husband. And that is
why the next day in the newspa-
per, the headlines declared:
   "ARTIE CHOKES TWO FOR A
DOLLAR AT SAFEWAY"


Witch's Brew


By Pudge Lehman
   I had arthroscopy on my knee
last week and breezed through
the recovery. My sister, Dawne,
came to take care of me but after
the first day I did so well I could
have been alone so we just
caught up on sister stuff. Almost
any leftover vegetable can be
added to scrambled eggs the next
day for breakfast or lunch. Left-
over corn can be added to leftover
pancake batter for fritters. Add
salt and pepper to taste and even
some shredded cheese if you like,
then fry. If you have several
recipes that call for a small
amount of lemon juice go ahead
and squeeze a lot of lemons and


freeze in ice
cube   trays.
Then put. in a
freezer bag
and take out
a cube at a
time.    For
some reason when I buy lemons I
use what is called for in my recipe
and then forget about the rest and
wind up throwing them out.
When a recipe calls for crumbled
bacon just cut it up with your
kitchen scissors before frying. It
cooks quicker and is easier to
crumble. Thought for the week: If
you want to see a cup runneth
over, let a toddler pour his own
milk.

   Governing Board approves
$20.5 million land purchase for
Indian River Lagoon reservoir,
natural storage area
   The South Florida Water Man-
agement District Governing Board
today unanimously authorized
the acquisition of approximately
1,245 acres in St. Lucie County for
$20.5 million - 14 percent less
than the appraised value - for
two Indian River Lagoon South
Restoration Project components:
The land will be used in conjunc-
tion  with   other properties
acquired for construction of the
C-23/24 South Reservoir and the
Cypress Creek/Trail Ridge Natural
Storage and Water Quality Area.
   "The District's steadfast com-


mitment to continue the momen-
tum to move forward with critical
land purchases for Everglades
restoration is demonstrated once
again in acquiring this property,"
said Governing Board Member
Lennart E. Lindahl. "I commend
our real estate staff and thank the
seller, Open Range Ranchettes,
for completing this significant
acquisition."
   The Indian River Lagoon
South Restoration Project is part
of the $8 billion Comprehensive
Everglades Restoration Plan, a
joint state-federal effort to restore
and revitalize the greater Ever-
glades ecosystem.
   The C-23/24 South Reservoir
is one of four above-ground


reservoirs planned in Martin and
St. Lucie counties to capture
water from the C-23, C-24, C-25
and C-44 (St. Lucie Canal)
canals. Collectively, these reser-
voirs will provide storage for bil-
lions of gallons of water, greatly
reducing the need to send large
volumes of fresh water caused by
stormwater runoff to the brack-
ish lagoon through the C-23, 24,
25 and 44 canals. The C-44 (St.
Lucie Canal) Reservoir is one of
the eight Everglades restoration
projects identified for accelerat-
ed construction under the Accel-
er8 program.
   The Cypress Creek/Trail Ridge
Natural Storage and Water Quali-
ty Area will hold billions of gal-


Ions of water and will provide"
increased wetland and upland
habitat for wildlife.
   The South Florida Water Man-
agement District is a regional,
governmental agency that over-
sees the water resources in the
southern half of the state - 16
counties from Orlando to the
Keys. It is the oldest and largest
of the state's five water manage-
ment districts. The agency mis-
sion is to manage and protect
water resources of the region by
balancing and improving water
quality, flood control, natural sys-
tems and water supply. A key ini-
tiative is cleanup and restoration
of the Everglades.


Effort to determine future of forests


   Florida Agriculture and Con-
sumer Services Commissioner
Charles H. Bronson announced
today that his department is
launching a major planning proj-
ect to help shape the future of
forests in Florida.
   "How are our forests going to
continue to provide the wood,
clean water, recreation and diver-
sity of wildlife 25 years from
now?" Bronson is asking. "And
what do we want them to look
like 25 years from now?"
   As a result of development,
hurricanes, wildfires, insect and
disease  outbreaks   and   the
demand for forestry products,


Florida's forests today comprise
only 14 million acres - down from
more than 20 million acres in the
1930's. Officials estimate that the
figure will decline to 12 million
acres by the year 2030.
   The planning effort that is get-
ting underway will focus on how
the state manages what are
inevitable changes - rather than
merely reacting to those changes.
   Division of Forestry (DOF) offi-
cials have already taken the first
step, assessing the present condi-
tions of forests in Florida, and the
public can review that assess-
ment by visiting DOF's website at
www.fl-dof.com.


   The public is encouraged to
participate by attending one of a
series of six workshops that will
be held around the state later this
month to solicit opinions on the
future of forests in Florida . The
dates, cities and locations are as
follows:
   March 22 - Milton - Pensacola
Junior College, University of Flori-
da Bldg, Room 4902.
   March 23 - Tallahassee - Eyster
Auditorium, Conner Bldg., 3125
Conner Blvd.
   March 24 - Lake City - Colum-
bia County Extension Service, 164
SW Mary Ethel Lane.
   March 29 - Tavares - Lake


County Ag/Horticulture Ext. Ser-
vice, 30205 State Road 19.
   March 30 - Palmetto- Manatee
County Ag Center/Fairgrounds,
Kendrick Auditorium, 1303 17th
St. West.
   March 31 - Lantana - Lantana,
Recreation Center, 418 South
Dixie Highway
   The regional workshops will
be held from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. and
will be lead by a professional facil-
itator.
   A draft plan on the future of
forests in Florida is expected to be
posted on the DOF website next
fall, and the public will be asked
to comment on it.


Survey: Don't ship alcohol to homes


   TALLAHASSEE - A poll of Flori-
da voters released today by
Mason-Dixon Polling & Research
shows that Floridians overwhelm-
ingly oppose proposals to allow
alcohol products to be shipped-
directly to homes in Florida.
   There are now at least three
bills filed in the state Legislature
that would legalize currently pro-
hibited methods of shipping alco-
hol products, such as wine, direct-
ly to homes - SB 906, SB 480 and
HB 975. The Florida Coalition to
Prevent Underage Drinking main-
tains that opening the door to
direct shipping will inevitably
make is easier for minors to order
beer, wine and liquor through
their computers and have it deliv-
ered to their homes, bypassing
Florida's system of alcohol con-
trol.
   "Floridians clearly recognize
that shipping alcohol products
directly to homes is risky, no mat-
ter what type of alcohol product it


is," said John  Fleming, a
spokesman for the Florida Coali-
tion to Prevent Underage Drink-
ing. "Out-of-state vendors are
already illicitly shipping alcohol
products directly to homes in
Florida, and minors are taking
advantage of this loophole to buy
alcohol. Legalizing direct shipping
makes the problem worse, not
better."
   According to a summary of the
poll provided by Mason-Dixon, the
poll found that a strong majority of
Florida voters oppose allowing
beer, wine and liquor to be sold
directly to consumers over the
Internet or through the mail.
Statewide, 65 percent indicated
they would oppose such alcohol
sales, while only 22 percent were
in favor and 13 percent were
undecided.
   A majority also opposed allow-
ing only wine to be sold over the
Internet. Statewide, 55 percent
were opposed to allowing the sale


of wine, 31 percent were in favor
and 14 percent were undecided.
   When presented with argu-
ments from each side about the
issue, voter opposition held firm,
with 68 percent saying that the
sale and shipment of beer, wine
and liquor over the Internet or
through the mail directly to con-
sumers should not be allowed,
compared to only 24 percent who
said it should be allowed. -
   A majority of Florida voters - 57
percent - also indicated they
would be" less likely" to vote for a
political leader who wants to
change state laws on alcohol sales
to make it legal for brewers,
wineries and distillers to ship beer,
wine and liquor directly to con-
sumers who place orders over the
Internet or by telephone.
   The poll was conducted Febru-
ary 24-27, 2005, by Mason-Dixon
Polling & Research of Washing-
ton, D.C. A total of 625 registered
Florida voters were interviewed


statewide by telephone. All indi-
cated they voted regularly in state
elections. The margin for error is
plus or minus four percent.
   The research was sponsored
by the Florida Coalition to Prevent
Underage Drinking- a group of
law enforcement agencies, clergy,
business leaders and community
groups. The Coalition is opposed
to proposals to legalize currently
prohibited shipments of alcohol
products - such as wine directly to
homes in Florida because such
shipments would give minors eas-
ier access to alcohol products.
